# Game dev in elixir with ECS

## What is Entity-Component-System (ECS)?

### Entity

* just an id

### Component

* just data
* `position, velocity, animation, texture, health, damage, attack, lighting_damage`, ...

### System

* logic
* takes all entities that have a specific sets of components on them and updates data an those components
* movement system takes all entities with position and `velocity`, updates position based on `velocity`

## What does that look like?

````elixir
```Elixir
new_state =
  old_state
  |> Snake.Systems.Movement.run()
  |> Snake.Systems.Animation.run()
  |> Snake.Systems.Collision.run()
  |> Snake.Systems.FoodEating.run()
  |> Snake.Systems.FoodSpawning.run()
```

# and then just render the state
````

## Isn't that perfect for elixir?

Yes, yes it is

Demo time!

## Should we use live view?

* For hobby or generally simple/casual games? Sure, why not?
* There's input lag
* Inefficient
* Great for multiplayer
* Partially fixed by more JS

## What else can we do?

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
:wx
:gl
```
